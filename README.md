# AVL Tree Visualizer ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ€

A fully interactive web-based AVL Tree Visualizer built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project demonstrates how AVL trees work step-by-step, including how insertions trigger **rotations** (LL, RR, LR, RL) to maintain balance.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸŒ³ Dynamically visualize AVL tree creation with **animated node insertion**.
- ðŸ”„ Observe **rotation types** (Left, Right, Left-Right, Right-Left) during balancing.
- ðŸ“ˆ Automatically draws connecting lines to represent tree structure.
- ðŸŽ¨ Clean, responsive UI with smooth animations.
- ðŸ‘£ Step-by-step insertion animation showing each transformation.

## ðŸ§  What is an AVL Tree?

An **AVL Tree** is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees is at most one for every node. If at any time this condition is violated, rebalancing is done through rotations.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ index.html       # Main HTML structure
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css        # Styles for UI and animation
â””â”€â”€ script.js        # Tree logic and DOM manipulation

````

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anirudhabg/AVLTreeVisualizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd AVLTreeVisualizer
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
   Just double-click or use a live server extension in VS Code.

4. **Enter nodes in the input box and visualize the AVL Tree!**
